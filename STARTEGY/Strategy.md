Strategy is a behavioral design pattern that Lets you define a family of algorithms, put each of them into a separate class, and make their objects interchangeable.


Design Principle that supports the Strategy 

- Identify the aspects of your application that vary and separate them from what stays the same 
- Program to an Interface Not an Implementation
- Favor composition over inheritance
